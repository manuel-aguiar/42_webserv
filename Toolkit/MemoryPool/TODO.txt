To properly test the Nginx_MemoryPool,
make it a template based on typename
Allocator, use the allocator to allocate intrrnal blocks

Nginx_MemoryPool_Impl<Allocator >

Then Nginx_MemoryPool is
typedef Nginx_MemoryPool<std::allocator<unsigned char> >

To test, create an allocator that keeps track of mallocs and frees
Nginx_MemoryPool_Impl<trackAllocator>

Use the pool normally and check how many
calls to new and delete were made, and how many bytes were used.
