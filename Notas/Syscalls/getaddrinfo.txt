NOT REALLY A SYSTEMCALL

https://jameshfisher.com/2018/02/03/what-does-getaddrinfo-do/


it is a DNS lookup, tries to fetch the possible addresses to communicate with the node through a port

In the example from the website, when connecting to google.com, the function uses a lot of system calls
to liunk libraries that hold the files in the file system that have the DNS servers place

contacts the DNS to get the address via socket, then verifies the conenction by opening another socket
for each relevant address and returns a linked list to all the relevant addresses


not thread-safe

as a server listening, via a single set of addresses (IPv4) for connections from anywhere (0.0.0.0)
theere is only one set of addresses that is relevant and we can place those inputs in the sockaddr_in struct

The client however, should use getaddrinfo to see what sort of ways does the webserver allow to communciate through

For us, not really relevant


In any case, getaddrinfo should only be used to setup the listening sockets for our viirtual hosts and nothing else
