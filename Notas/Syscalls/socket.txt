#include <sys/socket.h>
int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);

Domain -> communication domain (local, ipv4, VM, packet, netlink, bluetooth)
Type -> type of socket 
Protocol -> socket allows more protocols, in our case just place 0
###########################################################################


Creates an endpoint for communication, returns an FD
	AF -> address family


	AF_VSOCK -> communication between a VM and its host

	socket Type

	SOCK_STREAM -> byte stream communication, used for TCP communication

		It is the kernel that handles and implements the TCP/IP protocol stack

		connection-oriented -> before transmission "handshake" is required to establish a connection
		"Reliable" Data will be sent and read in order. If data is corrupted or lost, retransmits data

			when data is received, the receiver sends an acknowledgement to the sender
				if the sender doesn't receive confirmation after some time, data is resent
			checksum by receiver checks the integrity of data, if there is a problem, receiver asks the sender to send again
			packets are numbered such that the receiver can assemble them again in case they are received in different order

		Continuous stream of bytes (like reading from a file or a pipe)

		Flow Control -> acknowledgement packets to ensure the receiver can handle the data being sent

			Sliding window protocol -> control the ammount of data the sender can send before needing acknowledgment from the receiver
			Rate of transmission is dinamycally adusted dependeing on the receiver and network congestion.

				Both of these serve to minimize packet loss (no need to resend again)

	
	SOCK_RAW -> doesn't follow any particular protocol


	bitwise OR
		SOCK_NONBLOCK
		SOCK_CLOEXEC -> close on exec, mesma coisa que dup/dup2, para nao ter leaks

A SIGPIPE signal is
       raised if a process sends or receives on a broken stream;
