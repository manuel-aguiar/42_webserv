File descriptor flags vs file status flags

File descriptor flags affect the file descriptor itself:
	for example CLOEXEC -> close the file descfriptor if exceve

	-> done via F_SETFD

File status concern the file itself:
	-> O_APPEND set the offset at the end of the file
	-> NON_BLOCK -> any operation that would block, doesn't block anymore


	-> done via F_SETFL
