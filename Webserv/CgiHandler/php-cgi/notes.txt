Environment Variables for PHP-CGI:

For PHP-CGI, the environment variables used are very similar to those in Python-CGI, with a few differences or additions that PHP-specific configurations may rely on:

    REQUEST_METHOD:
        Specifies the HTTP request method (GET, POST, HEAD, etc.).

    QUERY_STRING:
        Contains the URL-encoded query string sent via a GET request.

    CONTENT_TYPE:
        Describes the type of data in the body of the request (e.g., application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data).

    CONTENT_LENGTH:
        Specifies the length of the request body (especially for POST requests).

    SCRIPT_NAME:
        The virtual path to the PHP script being executed.

    PATH_INFO:
        Extra path information following the script name in the URL.

    PATH_TRANSLATED:
        The physical path that corresponds to the virtual path in PATH_INFO.

    HTTP_COOKIE:
        The cookie data sent by the client, often used for sessions in PHP.

    REMOTE_ADDR:
        The IP address of the client making the request.

    REMOTE_HOST:
        The hostname of the client (if available).

    REMOTE_USER:
        The username sent in an HTTP authentication request, if applicable.

    AUTH_TYPE:
        The authentication type used by the server (e.g., Basic).

    SERVER_NAME:
        The server's hostname or IP address.

    SERVER_PORT:
        The port number on which the server is running (e.g., 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS).

    SERVER_PROTOCOL:
        The HTTP protocol version used in the request (e.g., HTTP/1.1).

    SERVER_SOFTWARE:
        The server software (e.g., Apache/2.4.41 or nginx/1.18.0).

    HTTP_USER_AGENT:
        The user-agent string from the client's browser or application.

    HTTP_REFERER:
        The URL of the page that referred the request, if applicable.

    PHP_SELF:
        The filename of the currently executing script, relative to the document root.

    GATEWAY_INTERFACE:
        The CGI specification version (e.g., CGI/1.1).

    DOCUMENT_ROOT:
        The document root directory from which the script is being executed.

    SCRIPT_FILENAME:
        The absolute path to the current script.

    REDIRECT_STATUS:
        Sometimes used by PHP-CGI to indicate the status after a redirection.
