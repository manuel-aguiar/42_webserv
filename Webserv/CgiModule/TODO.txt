add a modifyRequest to the API, enable disable read and disable write and maybe finish.

Make setters of cgirequest assert if
the state of the request is not acquired (user can only do changes like this in acquire)

modifyrequest will allow disable read and write.

if, request executing, simply ask the worker to disable events.
if queued, turn user read and user write to null, then the calls will return 0 and the worker will disable the read/write event.

Think if the user doesn t ha e anything to write yet, should the write be disabled? how to reenable?
