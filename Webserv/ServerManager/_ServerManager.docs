Server Manager is the brain of the infrastructure of our server.~
It will take the configuration file and use it to setup:

    All ServerWorkers

        HttpInterpreter
    


ServerWorker is essentially the old class "Server".
In our setup, this class is only needed in preparation for multithreading which 
may not implement.
    We leave it like this to allow for that feature potentially in the future
    Multithreading cannot take place via fork because threads will have to communicate
    with shared resources, namely the http interpreter


    It has its own:
        ConnectionManager
        CgiManager
        EventManager (and epoll)
        ListeningSockets (SO_REUSEPORT) for ALL listeners asked in configuration.



In terms of folder structure, ServerWorker is the holder of the managers (ex ServerManager)
but the folder nesting would be unnecessarily... deep.
