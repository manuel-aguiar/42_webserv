The ServerWorker will house all the components required for a single server to run:
    ListeningSockets;
    ConnectionManager;
    EventManager;


with these, it will run the server.

The two main methods are the following:

    prepareLaunch() -> this, opens up the previously prepared ListeningSockets and registers
        the base events requiered for the runtime of the server's internals
    run() -> run the server
