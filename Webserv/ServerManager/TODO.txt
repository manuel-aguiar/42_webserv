A Lot to do in ServerManager

-> deferentiate preparation from actual running, failures in preparation
    must result in exiting.

    So all opening of listening sockets and event manager subscription should be done
    in prep and not in .run()


-> Setup signalhandler


-> ConnectionManager is for sure allocating too much memory per Connection instance.
