The event manager will handle traffic on the various kernel buffers our program will use.
These buffers (pointed to by FileDescriptors) relate to, specifically:

	- ListeningSockets
		sockets ready to accept connections
	- Connection Sockets Reads
		we will have to be notified of when a client is sending traffic via a connection
		and be ready to read it
	- Connection Socket Writes
		we will need to respond to our client. the event manager will notify us when
		the client is ready to receive incoming data as we write it
	- SignalHandler Pipe
		we will use a pipe as the means to pass signals to our workers
		(best used for multithreading, which we may not implement, but pre-prepares such feature)
	- Cgi Pipe Writes
		http connections, after parsing a request, may need to call the CgiManager
		to execute scripts, and the message body will have to be passed to the script as it
		when it is read to read our message
	- Cgi Pipe Reads
		The cgi interpreter will write a message to the http connections in order for responses
		to be generated and sent to our client.

All the event manager deals with is Event class instances and nothing else.
Each user of the event manager will have to provide handler functions to reinterpret the Event
data* pointer to their relevant class and do their relevant work.
For instance:
	Signal Handler will take an event, use it to read the pipe.
	Cgi Pipe Write will take an event, set the handler function to cast data* to the relevant
	http connection for it to receive info.

	so on and so forth.

We are using function pointers instead of polymorphism yes...... because F polymorphism.

The event manager exists at the level of the worker. In a multithreading scenario, each worker will
have its own, independent, event manager to deal with it own file descriptors.
