todo list:
- http redirect (rafa)
- http directory listing  (passed to rafa)
- http error pages (rafa)

- http buffer read/write coordination (manuel)
- cgi module gateway to http (manuel)

- mod cgi module:
 - ticket system, minimal info
 - function pointer to fill form
 - ticket has user, fill pointer, timeout,
options, state
 - fill pointer tells module how to fill
the request (strings, IO etc)
 - request is part of worker, close in memory
 - fill is only called when there is a worker
ready (less memory on requests, allow more tickets
(num connections), request data close to worker
data, less dereferencing.
 - tickets heap array, circular queue of tickets
- check concurrency of pages
- IO SIGPIPE script pipe write is blocking, if i dont read a pipe
gets filled, it doesnt sigpipe,
simply blocks. Server waits for client write, reads script and writes to client
