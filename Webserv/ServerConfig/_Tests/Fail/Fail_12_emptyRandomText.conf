In the heart of the ancient forest, where the sunlight barely touched the forest floor, a strange, almost mystical hum filled the air. The trees, towering and ancient, whispered secrets of a time long forgotten. A lone wanderer ventured deeper into the woods, guided only by the faint glow of fireflies and the sound of a distant brook. With every step, the forest seemed to grow more alive, as if it recognized the presence of something... or someone.
The wanderer's heart raced as the ground beneath their feet shifted slightly, the moss soft and almost alive. They paused for a moment, listening. A soft voice echoed through the trees, barely audible but clear enough to make them stop and wonder: "The forest remembers, and it will guide those who listen."
But who was listening?
