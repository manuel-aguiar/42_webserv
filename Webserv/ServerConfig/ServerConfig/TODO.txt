ServerConfig will need to save
bith u_sockaddr and t_addrlen,
will be needed by the listening socket
::bind

So, create a struct with both,
get the addrlen from t_addrinfo,
create the struct and push to the vector
the full package.

serverblock vector of listenSockaddr
will point the u_sockaddr of the
struct

add some typedefs directly on the 
.cpp file to easy the visual pain.
these are only used in the helper 
structs, no need to be global
