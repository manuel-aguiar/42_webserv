1xx (Informational): The request was received, continuing process
2xx (Successful): The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted
3xx (Redirection): Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request
4xx (Client Error): The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request

if client doesn't recognize the status code, it should treat it as x00. example: 471 (?) treat as 400 (bad request)
if client receives code x00 with x > 5, treat as 500 -> server error
