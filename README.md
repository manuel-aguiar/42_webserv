Folders:
    Notes: general notes about the concepts we are dealing with here
    Sandbox: small programs to experiment with the above concepts
    Testing: folder for all the tests to our project, to avoid mixing testing code with production code.
        right now, we have mock websites there for testing
    Toolkit: some containers reprogrammed, not finished and probably we should not use them
    Webserv: production code for the webserver





Testing:
    we should probably have tests centralized and outside of the main project code.
    So, folder Testing is where all the tests will be placed.

    To avoid confusion, if you are testing a particular class or function,
    either create a folder named after it and place alll files inside (including mock representations of dependencies)
